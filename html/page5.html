<h1><center>Add sound effects.</center></h1>

The ten buttons 1-0 at the top of the screen are for sound effects and jingles, you could add a file to button one for applause for example.<br><br>

At my bar we have theme music for some regular singers, for example when a retired policeman comes up to sing, the theme tune to a popular cops and robbers TV series is played.<br><br>

Press the E button and brows to the files you want to pin to each of the ten buttons.<br><br>
