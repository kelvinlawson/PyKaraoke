Click on C to open the config window, and the first tab will allow you to configure the size and placement of the playback screen.<br><br>

This is a bit trial and error, unselect the default placement, and in the player placement give the location and size of monitor two.<br><br>

You may also want to Enable player with no frame.<br><br>
