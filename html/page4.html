<h1><center>Performers screen tab one.</center></h1>

Usage of the main search screen is fairly simple, type something in the search box, for example elv pre ghe and it should find the song Elvis Presley, In The Ghetto.<br><br>

You can then select it and press play, or send it to the play list, where you can include the name of the karaoke singer if that option is set in the config file.<br><br>

Then select it and play it from the play screen.<br><br>

If you have set up the play background music option and have files in the background play list, they will start playing as soon as the song in the tab one performers play list has finished.<br><br>
