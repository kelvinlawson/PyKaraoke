<h1><center>Background music.</center></h1>

To set up background music, go to background tab 2, and brows to your background music folder, its best to have this music in separate folders to simplify selection.<br><br>

Brows to these folders, and click select, the songs will be added to the left hand panel.<br><br>

Select the ones you want to play in the background, press the arrow to transfer them to the auto play panel.<br><br>

Press B and set auto play, and a suitable time delay, I like it at 3 seconds, and thats about all you have to do.<br><br>

Playing a karaoke song on the performers stops the background music, you do have to press play twice, once to stop the background music, and a second time to start the selected karaoke song.<br><br>

When it has finished the background music will start up again.<br><br>
