<h1><center>Welcome to PyKaraoke</center></h1>

If you have got this far you must have successfully installed PyKaraoke on your computer,
 and must have the required support packages installed, these are.<br>
<br>
Python to run the program<br>
WxPython the support libraries to run everything<br>
pillow for the round buttons<br>
VLC for the media playback<br>
<br>

If you don't have them, wxpython and pillow can easily be installed using pip on the command line.<br><br>

pip install pillow<br><br>
pip install wxpython<br><br>

Note that VLC is at the time of writing a 32 bit application on windows, so the 32 bit version of Python 2.7 
is needed if running from inside a Python enviroment.<br><br>

Linux users can use 64 bit Python 2.7.<br><br>
