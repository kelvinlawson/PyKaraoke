First install some karaoke files.<br><br>

If you only have a small collection of karaoke files,
 the fastest way to be up and running is to copy them all into one folder on your hard drive.<br><br>

Start PyKaraoke, select tab two the Background Screen.<br><br>

Click on the B button for the background music options and make sure that the continuous play option is not selected.<br><br>

Now click on the musical notes icon on the search results left hand screen and brows to where you have stored your karaoke songs.<br><br>

Select the folder that contains them and click on open, all your karaoke music will now be in the left hand search screen.<br><br>

You can simply select the ones you want to play, then click on the arrow to send them to the play window.<br><br>

You can now click on the one you want to play, and press the play button, or if you prefer it you can  turn on continuous play,
 and play them all one after the other.<br><br>
